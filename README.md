# LightConv

This is a simple (but complete) implementation of a convolution neural network (CNN) in C++.

It uses Opencv (just for loading and displaying images) and the C++ standard library.

I want to use this code as a prototype for a future, highly customizeable, C++ library that will encompass many neural network architectures (similar to tensorflow)
